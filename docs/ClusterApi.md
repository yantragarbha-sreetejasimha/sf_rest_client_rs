# **get_cluster_health_chunk_using_policy_and_advanced_filters**
> ::models::ClusterHealthChunk get_cluster_health_chunk_using_policy_and_advanced_filters(api_version, optional)
Gets the health of a Service Fabric cluster using health chunks.

Gets the health of a Service Fabric cluster using health chunks. The health evaluation is done based on the input cluster health chunk query description. The query description allows users to specify health policies for evaluating the cluster and its children. Users can specify very flexible filters to select which cluster entities to return. The selection can be done based on the entities health state and based on the hierarchy. The query can return multi-level children of the entities based on the specified filters. For example, it can return one application with a specified name, and for this application, return only services that are in Error or Warning, and all partitions and replicas for one of these services.

 **cluster_health_chunk_query_description** | [**ClusterHealthChunkQueryDescription**](ClusterHealthChunkQueryDescription.md)| Describes the cluster and application health policies used to evaluate the cluster health and the filters to select which cluster entities to be returned. If the cluster health policy is present, it is used to evaluate the cluster events and the cluster nodes. If not present, the health evaluation uses the cluster health policy defined in the cluster manifest or the default cluster health policy. By default, each application is evaluated using its specific application health policy, defined in the application manifest, or the default health policy, if no policy is defined in manifest. If the application health policy map is specified, and it has an entry for an application, the specified application health policy is used to evaluate the application health. Users can specify very flexible filters to select which cluster entities to include in response. The selection can be done based on the entities health state and based on the hierarchy. The query can return multi-level children of the entities based on the specified filters. For example, it can return one application with a specified name, and for this application, return only services that are in Error or Warning, and all partitions and replicas for one of these services. |

If IncludeSystemApplicationHealthStatistics is set to true, the health statistics include the entities that belong to the fabric:/System application. Otherwise, the query result includes health statistics only for user applications. The health statistics must be included in the query result for this parameter to be applied. | [default to false]
 **cluster_health_policies** | [**ClusterHealthPolicies**](ClusterHealthPolicies.md)| Describes the health policies used to evaluate the cluster health. If not present, the health evaluation uses the cluster health policy defined in the cluster manifest or the default cluster health policy. By default, each application is evaluated using its specific application health policy, defined in the application manifest, or the default health policy, if no policy is defined in manifest. If the application health policy map is specified, and it has an entry for an application, the specified application health policy is used to evaluate the application health. | 
 **timeout** | **i64**| The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds. | [default to 60]

Get the Service Fabric cluster manifest.

Get the Service Fabric cluster manifest. The cluster manifest contains properties of the cluster that include different node types on the cluster, security configurations, fault, and upgrade domain topologies, etc.  These properties are specified as part of the ClusterConfig.JSON file while deploying a stand-alone cluster. However, most of the information in the cluster manifest is generated internally by service fabric during cluster deployment in other deployment scenarios (e.g. when using Azure portal).  The contents of the cluster manifest are for informational purposes only and users are not expected to take a dependency on the format of the file contents or its interpretation.

This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.  Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version. | [default to 6.0]
 **health_information** | [**HealthInformation**](HealthInformation.md)| Describes the health information for the health report. This information needs to be present in all of the health reports sent to the health manager. | 
 **immediate** | **bool**| A flag that indicates whether the report should be sent immediately. A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store. If Immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from HTTP Gateway to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the HTTP Gateway Application is using. This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible. Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail, for example if the HTTP Gateway is closed or the message doesn&#39;t reach the Gateway. If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client settings from the HTTP Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to the HealthReportSendInterval configuration. This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing. By default, reports are not sent immediately. | [default to false]
 **timeout** | **i64**| The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds. | [default to 60]
