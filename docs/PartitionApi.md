### Required Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
  **api_version** | **String**| The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be &#39;6.0&#39;.  Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.  Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version. | [default to 6.0]
  **partition_id** | [**String**](.md)| The identity of the partition. | 
 **optional** | **map[string]interface{}** | optional parameters | nil if no parameters

### Optional Parameters
Optional parameters are passed through a map[string]interface{}.

# **get_partition_health_using_policy**
> ::models::PartitionHealth get_partition_health_using_policy(api_version, partition_id, optional)
Gets the health of the specified Service Fabric partition, by using the specified health policy.

Gets the health information of the specified partition. If the application health policy is specified, the health evaluation uses it to get the aggregated health state. If the policy is not specified, the health evaluation uses the application health policy defined in the application manifest, or the default health policy, if no policy is defined in the manifest. Use EventsHealthStateFilter to filter the collection of health events reported on the partition based on the health state. Use ReplicasHealthStateFilter to filter the collection of ReplicaHealthState objects on the partition. Use ApplicationHealthPolicy in the POST body to override the health policies used to evaluate the health. If you specify a partition that does not exist in the health store, this request returns an error.

# **recover_partition**
> recover_partition(partition_id, api_version, optional)
Indicates to the Service Fabric cluster that it should attempt to recover a specific partition that is currently stuck in quorum loss.

This operation should only be performed if it is known that the replicas that are down cannot be recovered. Incorrect use of this API can cause potential data loss.

### Required Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
  **partition_id** | [**String**](.md)| The identity of the partition. | 
  **api_version** | **String**| The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be &#39;6.0&#39;.  Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.  Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version. | [default to 6.0]
 **optional** | **map[string]interface{}** | optional parameters | nil if no parameters

### Optional Parameters
Optional parameters are passed through a map[string]interface{}.

# **report_partition_health**
> report_partition_health(api_version, partition_id, health_information, optional)
Sends a health report on the Service Fabric partition.

Reports health state of the specified Service Fabric partition. The report must contain the information about the source of the health report and property on which it is reported. The report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Partition, which forwards to the health store. The report may be accepted by the gateway, but rejected by the health store after extra validation. For example, the health store may reject the report because of an invalid parameter, like a stale sequence number. To see whether the report was applied in the health store, run GetPartitionHealth and check that the report appears in the HealthEvents section.

### Required Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
  **api_version** | **String**| The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be &#39;6.0&#39;.  Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.

However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version. | [default to 6.0]
  **partition_id** | [**String**](.md)| The identity of the partition. | 
  **health_information** | [**HealthInformation**](HealthInformation.md)| Describes the health information for the health report. This information needs to be present in all of the health reports sent to the health manager. | 
 **optional** | **map[string]interface{}** | optional parameters | nil if no parameters

### Optional Parameters
Optional parameters are passed through a map[string]interface{}.

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **api_version** | **String**| The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be &#39;6.0&#39;.  Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.

However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version. | [default to 6.0]
 **partition_id** | [**String**](.md)| The identity of the partition. | 
 **health_information** | [**HealthInformation**](HealthInformation.md)| Describes the health information for the health report. This information needs to be present in all of the health reports sent to the health manager. | 
 **immediate** | **bool**| A flag that indicates whether the report should be sent immediately. A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store. If Immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from HTTP Gateway to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the HTTP Gateway Application is using. This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible. Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail, for example if the HTTP Gateway is closed or the message doesn&#39;t reach the Gateway. If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client settings from the HTTP Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to the HealthReportSendInterval configuration. This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing. By default, reports are not sent immediately. | [default to false]
 **timeout** | **i64**| The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds. | [default to 60]
