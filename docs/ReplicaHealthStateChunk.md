# ReplicaHealthStateChunk

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**health_state** | [***::models::HealthState**](HealthState.md) | The health state of a Service Fabric entity such as Cluster, Node, Application, Service, Partition, Replica etc. | [optional] [default to null]
**replica_or_instance_id** | [***::models::ReplicaOrInstanceId**](ReplicaOrInstanceId.md) | Id of a stateful service replica or a stateless service instance. This ID is used in the queries that apply to both stateful and stateless services. It is used by Service Fabric to uniquely identify a replica of a partition of a stateful service or an instance of a stateless service partition. It is unique within a partition and does not change for the lifetime of the replica or the instance. If a stateful replica gets dropped and another replica gets created on the same node for the same partition, it will get a different value for the ID. If a stateless instance is failed over on the same or different node it will get a different value for the ID. | [optional] [default to null]
