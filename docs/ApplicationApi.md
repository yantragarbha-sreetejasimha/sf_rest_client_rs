### Required Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
  **api_version** | **String**| The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be &#39;6.0&#39;.  Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.  Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version. | [default to 6.0]
  **application_description** | [**ApplicationDescription**](ApplicationDescription.md)| Description for creating an application. | 
 **optional** | **map[string]interface{}** | optional parameters | nil if no parameters

# **delete_application**
> delete_application(api_version, application_id, optional)
Deletes an existing Service Fabric application.

An application must be created before it can be deleted. Deleting an application will delete all services that are part of that application. By default, Service Fabric will try to close service replicas in a graceful manner and then delete the service. However, if a service is having issues closing the replica gracefully, the delete operation may take a long time or get stuck. Use the optional ForceRemove flag to skip the graceful close sequence and forcefully delete the application and all of its services.

### Required Parameters

Filters ApplicationTypeName and ApplicationDefinitionKindFilter cannot be specified at the same time.

### Required Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
  **api_version** | **String**| The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be &#39;6.1&#39;.  Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.  Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version. | [default to 6.1]
 **optional** | **map[string]interface{}** | optional parameters | nil if no parameters

### Optional Parameters
Optional parameters are passed through a map[string]interface{}.

# **get_deployed_application_info_list**
> ::models::PagedDeployedApplicationInfoList get_deployed_application_info_list(api_version, node_name, optional)
Gets the list of applications deployed on a Service Fabric node.

Gets the list of applications deployed on a Service Fabric node. The results do not include information about deployed system applications unless explicitly queried for by ID. Results encompass deployed applications in active, activating, and downloading states. This query requires that the node name corresponds to a node on the cluster. The query fails if the provided node name does not point to any active Service Fabric nodes on the cluster.

### Required Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
  **api_version** | **String**| The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be &#39;6.1&#39;.  Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.  Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version. | [default to 6.1]
  **node_name** | **String**| The name of the node. | 
 **optional** | **map[string]interface{}** | optional parameters | nil if no parameters

### Optional Parameters
Optional parameters are passed through a map[string]interface{}.

 **node_name** | **String**| The name of the node. | 
 **timeout** | **i64**| The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds. | [default to 60]
 **include_health_state** | **bool**| Include the health state of an entity. If this parameter is false or not specified, then the health state returned is \&quot;Unknown\&quot;. When set to true, the query goes in parallel to the node and the health system service before the results are merged. As a result, the query is more expensive and may take a longer time. | [default to false]
 **continuation_token** | **String**| The continuation token parameter is used to obtain next set of results. A continuation token with a non-empty value is included in the response of the API when the results from the system do not fit in a single response. When this value is passed to the next API call, the API returns next set of results. If there are no further results, then the continuation token does not contain a value. The value of this parameter should not be URL encoded. | 
 **max_results** | **i64**| The maximum number of results to be returned as part of the paged queries. This parameter defines the upper bound on the number of results returned. The results returned can be less than the specified maximum results if they do not fit in the message as per the max message size restrictions defined in the configuration. If this parameter is zero or not specified, the paged query includes as many results as possible that fit in the return message. | [default to 0]

# **report_application_health**
> report_application_health(api_version, application_id, health_information, optional)
Sends a health report on the Service Fabric application.

Reports health state of the specified Service Fabric application. The report must contain the information about the source of the health report and property on which it is reported. The report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store. The report may be accepted by the gateway, but rejected by the health store after extra validation. For example, the health store may reject the report because of an invalid parameter, like a stale sequence number. To see whether the report was applied in the health store, get application health and check that the report appears in the HealthEvents section.

### Required Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
  **api_version** | **String**| The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be &#39;6.0&#39;.  Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.

However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version. | [default to 6.0]
  **application_id** | **String**| The identity of the application. This is typically the full name of the application without the &#39;fabric:&#39; URI scheme. Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the \&quot;~\&quot; character. For example, if the application name is \&quot;fabric:/myapp/app1\&quot;, the application identity would be \&quot;myapp~app1\&quot; in 6.0+ and \&quot;myapp/app1\&quot; in previous versions. | 
  **health_information** | [**HealthInformation**](HealthInformation.md)| Describes the health information for the health report. This information needs to be present in all of the health reports sent to the health manager. | 
 **optional** | **map[string]interface{}** | optional parameters | nil if no parameters

 **health_information** | [**HealthInformation**](HealthInformation.md)| Describes the health information for the health report. This information needs to be present in all of the health reports sent to the health manager. | 
 **immediate** | **bool**| A flag that indicates whether the report should be sent immediately. A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store. If Immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from HTTP Gateway to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the HTTP Gateway Application is using. This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible. Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail, for example if the HTTP Gateway is closed or the message doesn&#39;t reach the Gateway. If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client settings from the HTTP Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to the HealthReportSendInterval configuration. This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing. By default, reports are not sent immediately. | [default to false]
 **timeout** | **i64**| The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds. | [default to 60]

 **application_id** | **String**| The identity of the application. This is typically the full name of the application without the &#39;fabric:&#39; URI scheme. Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the \&quot;~\&quot; character. For example, if the application name is \&quot;fabric:/myapp/app1\&quot;, the application identity would be \&quot;myapp~app1\&quot; in 6.0+ and \&quot;myapp/app1\&quot; in previous versions. | 
 **application_update_description** | [**ApplicationUpdateDescription**](ApplicationUpdateDescription.md)| Parameters for updating an existing application instance. | 
 **timeout** | **i64**| The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds. | [default to 60]

# **update_application_upgrade**
> update_application_upgrade(api_version, application_id, application_upgrade_update_description, optional)
Updates an ongoing application upgrade in the Service Fabric cluster.

Updates the parameters of an ongoing application upgrade from the ones specified at the time of starting the application upgrade. This may be required to mitigate stuck application upgrades due to incorrect parameters or issues in the application to make progress.

### Required Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
  **api_version** | **String**| The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be &#39;6.0&#39;.  Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.  Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version. | [default to 6.0]
  **application_id** | **String**| The identity of the application. This is typically the full name of the application without the &#39;fabric:&#39; URI scheme. Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the \&quot;~\&quot; character. For example, if the application name is \&quot;fabric:/myapp/app1\&quot;, the application identity would be \&quot;myapp~app1\&quot; in 6.0+ and \&quot;myapp/app1\&quot; in previous versions. | 
  **application_upgrade_update_description** | [**ApplicationUpgradeUpdateDescription**](ApplicationUpgradeUpdateDescription.md)| Parameters for updating an existing application upgrade. | 
 **optional** | **map[string]interface{}** | optional parameters | nil if no parameters

### Optional Parameters
Optional parameters are passed through a map[string]interface{}.
