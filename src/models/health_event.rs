The property is a string and not a fixed enumeration to allow the reporter flexibility to categorize the state condition that triggers the report. For example, a reporter with SourceId \"LocalWatchdog\" can monitor the state of the available disk on a node, so it can report \"AvailableDisk\" property on that node. The same reporter can monitor the node connectivity, so it can report a property \"Connectivity\" on the same node. In the health store, these reports are treated as separate health events for the specified node.  Together with the SourceId, the property uniquely identifies the health information.

When time to live expires, the health event that contains the health information is either removed from health store, if RemoveWhenExpired is true, or evaluated at error, if RemoveWhenExpired false.

If the provided string is longer, it will be automatically truncated. When truncated, the last characters of the description contain a marker \"[Truncated]\", and total string size is 4096 characters. The presence of the marker indicates to users that truncation occurred. Note that when truncated, the description has less than 4096 characters from the original string.

If set to false, the report is treated as an error when expired. The value of this property is false by default. When clients report periodically, they should set RemoveWhenExpired false (default). This way, is the reporter has issues (eg. deadlock) and can't report, the entity is evaluated at error when the health report expires. This flags the entity as being in Error health state.
