/// ChaosTargetFilter : Defines all filters for targeted Chaos faults, for example, faulting only certain node types or faulting only certain applications. If ChaosTargetFilter is not used, Chaos faults all cluster entities. If ChaosTargetFilter is used, Chaos faults only the entities that meet the ChaosTargetFilter specification. NodeTypeInclusionList and ApplicationInclusionList allow a union semantics only. It is not possible to specify an intersection of NodeTypeInclusionList and ApplicationInclusionList. For example, it is not possible to specify \"fault this application only when it is on that node type.\" Once an entity is included in either NodeTypeInclusionList or ApplicationInclusionList, that entity cannot be excluded using ChaosTargetFilter. Even if applicationX does not appear in ApplicationInclusionList, in some Chaos iteration applicationX can be faulted because it happens to be on a node of nodeTypeY that is included in NodeTypeInclusionList. If both NodeTypeInclusionList and ApplicationInclusionList are null or empty, an ArgumentException is thrown.

All types of faults (restart node, restart code package, remove replica, restart replica, move primary, and move secondary) are enabled for the nodes of these node types. If a node type (say NodeTypeX) does not appear in the NodeTypeInclusionList, then node level faults (like NodeRestart) will never be enabled for the nodes of NodeTypeX, but code package and replica faults can still be enabled for NodeTypeX if an application in the ApplicationInclusionList. happens to reside on a node of NodeTypeX. At most 100 node type names can be included in this list, to increase this number, a config upgrade is required for MaxNumberOfNodeTypesInChaosEntityFilter configuration.
