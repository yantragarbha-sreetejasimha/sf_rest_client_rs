/// InstanceCloseDelayDurationInSeconds : Duration in seconds, to wait before a stateless instance is closed, to allow the active requests to drain gracefully. This would be effective when the instance is closing during the application/cluster upgrade, only for those instances which have a non-zero delay duration configured in the service description. See InstanceCloseDelayDurationSeconds property in $ref: \"#/definitions/StatelessServiceDescription.yaml\" for details. Note, the default value of InstanceCloseDelayDurationInSeconds is 4294967295, which indicates that the behavior will entirely depend on the delay configured in the stateless service description.
