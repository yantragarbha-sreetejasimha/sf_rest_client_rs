/// CheckSequencePropertyBatchOperation : Compares the Sequence Number of a property with the SequenceNumber argument. A property's sequence number can be thought of as that property's version. Every time the property is modified, its sequence number is increased. The sequence number can be found in a property's metadata. The comparison fails if the sequence numbers are not equal. CheckSequencePropertyBatchOperation is generally used as a precondition for the write operations in the batch. Note that if one PropertyBatchOperation in a PropertyBatch fails, the entire batch fails and cannot be committed in a transactional manner.
